"""Regression tests for ``CallGraphIndexer`` shared-instance index race.

Mirrors the ``RAGSearcher`` race fixed earlier. ``CallGraphIndexer`` is shared
**by reference** across in-process parallel subagents
(``ToolRegistry.clone_for_subagent`` / ``clone_with_filter`` both assign
``clone._call_graph = self._call_graph``). A subagent's write-success callback
(``_invalidate_cache_after_write`` -> ``CallGraphIndexer.invalidate``) clears the
index dicts (``_nodes`` / ``_forward`` / ``_reverse``) while a *sibling*
subagent's analysis tool (``analyze_change_impact`` / ``query_dependency_graph``
/ ``find_references``) traverses the very same dicts.

The ``RepositoryGraphFacade._rebuild_lock`` does **not** protect this path:
``get_callers``/``get_callees`` delegate straight to the indexer when it is set,
and the write callback calls ``invalidate()`` on the indexer directly — both
bypass the facade lock. With no lock on the indexer itself, under concurrency:

  * **Crash:** ``_lookup_edges`` suffix-fallback iterates ``index.items()`` while
    a concurrent ``invalidate()`` calls ``dict.clear()`` ->
    ``RuntimeError('dictionary changed size during iteration')`` (reproduced with
    a 4-reader + 2-invalidator stress under ``setswitchinterval(1e-6)``).
  * **Build/build race (silent):** two readers both observe ``_built=False`` and
    rebuild concurrently, interleaving dict writes -> lost updates / partial index.

The fix adds a single ``threading.RLock`` guarding ``build``/``invalidate``/
``_ensure_built`` (double-checked) and every reader (``get_callees``/
``get_callers``/``_lookup_edges``), with ``get_related_symbols`` holding the lock
across its whole multi-step read. RLock makes the nested ``_resolve_callees`` and
``get_callees``/``get_callers`` calls reentrant.

These tests assert (1) no crash under the mixed reader/invalidator stress, and
(2) the index rebuilds to a consistent, non-empty state afterwards.
